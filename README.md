# Software-Test-Automation-and-QA
In order to ensure that my code is functional and secure I do a lot of tests.  I found the coverage tool to be especially helpful for making sure Ive looked at every aspect of my code.
Users may have a variety of needs from any given program which makes it very difficult to make a blanket statment that shows how I might interpret user needs into a program.  Generally, secure and functional code would probably be a requirement for any program so testing would play an essential role.  Reading the program requirements would be helpful in determining the other needs a user might have.
My approach to designing software changes depending on the requirements of the program.  When I am writing software that collects large amounts of data, I use an object oriented approach.  I am more concerned with the structure and management of the data than the mining functions.  When I write programs that involve processing of data, I use a function oriented approach.  Regardless of which approach I take, I tend to start with skeletal code that does the bare minimum and add features from there.
